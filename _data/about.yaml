  Exploration of Microtubule Dynamic Instability

Abstract: >
    Microtubules are structural proteins implicated in a variety of cellular functions from intracellular organelle transport to mitosis. They consist of tubulin building blocks organized into a cylindrical array of thirteen protofilaments.  Central to their role in mitosis is the ability of microtubules to rapidly polymerize and depolymerize at one end, termed dynamic instability. Dynamic instability is a process driven by GTP hydrolysis-- GTP-bound tubulin is added to the ends of growing microtubles; hydrolysis of GTP to GDP results in rapid microtubule depolymerization. The ability of microtubles to grow and shrink in this manner is critical to many cellular processes-- the complete rearrangement of microtubules during mitosis is one example. At some point during their lifetimes, the alternating growth and shortening events suddenly transition to a period dominated by depolymerization. This phenomenon, known as microtubule collapse, had long been poorly understood by the scientific community. Here, we explore a dataset compiled by Gardner et al., presented in [this Cell paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2011.10.037). We find that microtubule catastrophe is a Gamma-distributed process, indicating that catastrophe is a series of depolymerization events occurring at the same rate. Additionally, we observe that increasing tubulin concentrations delay the onset of catastrophe, indicating that the addition of tubulin can prolong the period of growth and shortening. In the analysis that follows, we will present the statistical inference that we conducted to arrive at our conclusions.

Experimental Methods:  >
    Gardner and coworkers monitored the dynamic instability of individual microtubules mainly via TIRF microscopy. Tubulin "seeds", or stable foundations for microtubule growth, were labeled with rhodamine dye and fixed to a glass coverslip. GTP-bound tubulin, labeled with the fluorophore Alexa-488, was flowed over the coverslips and allowed to polymerize onto the immobilized tubulin seeds. Use of two distinct dyes enabled the researchers to distinctly observe and measure the polymerization and depolymerization events-- the green tubulin could clearly be seen growing from the red tubulin seeds in real time. To confirm that the presence of the Alexa-488 dye did not interfere with the growth events, the authors performed a control experiment in which they monitored growth and depolymerization with unlabeled tubulin via differential interference contrast microscopy. 


    The following images were collected in a study by Varga et al., published in Nature in 2006. While not exactly representative of the images generated in this study, the images show how fluorescently labeled tubulin can be incorporated into microtubules through dynamic instability. This Nature study equipped Gardner and coworkers with the experimental methods used to generate the data that we'll now explore!
 
Statistical Methods Employed: > 
    We conduct statistical inference through a number of analyses, described here and in later sections. We demonstrate that there is no difference in time to microtubule catastrophe for labeled versus unlabeled tubulin through generation of bootstrap samples, calculation of statistical functionals and confidence intervals, and a null hypothesis significance test. To model the occurrence of microtubule catastrophe, we consider both the Gamma and Poisson distributions. We generate each of these models parameterized by data obtained by Gardner and coworkers, then conduct graphical and non-graphical model assessment to identify the more appropriate model.

Does tubulin labeling affect microtubule growth?: >
    The authors' TIRF experiment utilized Alexa-488 dye to image tubulin polymerization onto microtubules. To confirm that the dye doesn't interfere with dynamic instability, the authors conducted a control experiment in which they monitor the time to catastrophe for both labeled and unlabeled tubulin. We evaluate the results of that experiment here.


    **Comparison of plug-in estimates**


    While evaluation by eye cannot replace more rigorous statistical inference, an eye test can be useful for initial assessment of the data. A plot of ECDFs for the time to catastrophe for labeled and unlabeled tubulin reveals that the two distributions are similar, however not identical (Figure 3). The 95% confidence regions generated in iqplot overlap significantly (Figure 3, shaded regions); however these observations are not enough to make conclusive statements regarding the similarity of the two distributions.


    Calculating plug-in estimates, such as the mean, from the empirical distributions is another method of quick-checking the data for similarity but cannot provide any definite conclusions. These calculations show that the mean time to catastrophe is 440.7 seconds for labeled tubulin and 412.5 seconds for unlabeled tubulin. Once again, these values are similar, but in reality the mean of unlabeled tubulin is 93.6% the mean of labeled tubulin-- the two are not identical. 


    Obtaining and comparing confidence intervals for the mean times to catastrophe provides more insight toward the similarity of this plug-in estimate than simply comparing two values does. Bootstrapping from the empirical data with a sample size of $n = 10000$, we generate 10,000 bootstrap replicates of the mean (Figure 4). Using these bootstrap replicates in our calculation of confidence intervals shows that the 95% confidence interval for the mean time to catastrophe for labeled tubulin is [401.87, 482.18] seconds, while this 95% confidence interval for unlabeled tubulin is [354.05, 476.32] seconds. These confidence intervals are similar, but the labeled confidence interval is narrower, and shifted towards longer values than, the unlabeled interval. Both of these phenomena are expected: there are more labeled datapoints, so we would expect a narrower confidence interval; additionally, as seen above, the mean of the labeled waiting times is above the mean of the unlabeled waiting times. As an aside, the two ECDFs of the mean times to catastrophe look like Normal distributions as the means of the samples obey the central limit theorerm. We confirm this observation through overlay of the ECDFs with theoretical CDFs of the normal distribution parameterized by the labeled and unlabeled tubulin data (Figure 5).


    **Construction of confidence intervals**


    We use theory to construct 95% confidence intervals for the ECDFs of the raw data (Figure 6). Specifically, we use the Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz Inequality (DKW) to identify upper and lower bounds between which lie the 95% confidence intervals. These upper and lower bounds correspond to the maximum distances between the ECDF and the generative CDF in the positive and negative directions.


    There are some similarities and some differences between the confidence intervals from theory and those from bootstrapping (Figure 6). In both cases, the confidence intervals are wider for the unlabeled microtubules: this is expected, as the width of the confidence interval is inversely proportional to the root of the number of points. On the other hand, the confidence intervals are wider for the theoretical plot than the bootstrapped plot. This phenomenon could be attributed to the fact that these theoretical intervals come from upper bounds, which might be quite conservative.


    Overall, there is very significant overlap of the theoretical confidence intervals for labeled an unlabeled tubulin, which supports the observations we have made thus far that the two are very similarly distributed.


    **Null hypothesis significance testing**


    We use NHST to test the hypothesis that the catastrophe time distributions are exactly the same for labeled and unlabeled microtubules. Given this hypothesis, we can use the permutation method: that is to say, under they hypothesis, labeled and unlabeled datapoints come from the exact same generative distribution, and so any difference in any statistical functional (e.g. mean, variance) between the two sets has arisen randomly when we sampled the underlying distribution to divide into these sets. Consequently, to test this hypothesis, we can combine all of the datapoints into a single set, and repeat the process of randomly dividing them into two samples with containing the same number of points as the experimental samples: under the hypothesis, this is how the experimental data were generated! We compute the statistical functionals on these 'permuation' samples, and see how often this is as extreme as it is for the experimental samples.


    If we were to take a less conservative hypothesis, such that the sample means are the same but other functionals need not be the same, we would need to use a different approach to test it. (e.g. in this case, shifting the distributions to have the same mean, and seeing how often the bootstrapped mean difference is as large as the experimental value).


    Given the hypothesis that the distributions are identical, if any statistical functional were found to be significantly different between the samples, we would reject the null hypothesis. We calculate the first (mean), second (variance), and third (skewness) moments as our statistical functionals, and find that the p-values are approximately 0.2, 0.6, and 0.9 for mean, variance, and skewness, respectively. For each of these statistical functionals, the p-value is above alpha = 0.001, and so we cannot use any of these as a reason to reject the null hypothesis.


    Together, our findings from this section support our hypothesis that the distributions of time to catastrophe for labeled and unlabeled tubulin are similar. Until this point, we have not found any evidence to state that the two are significantly dissimilar. Therefore, we will assume that the Alexa-488 dye has no meaningful effect on dynamic instability, and from here on we will explore the data only considering labeled tubulin.
